# Dashboard_task
This will be a desktop app available for Linux in the first version.

This README will be use to create all the documentation for this proyect.

This proyect be created as an exercise for my experience.

## 1. How will it work?
1. It will show a calendar where you can see all the activities you have in your routine like classes, work time, gym, meetings likes dailies, etc...
2. You will be able to create a task that could be associate with a specific activity on your routine. For example, in a POO class you have to create a simple presentation, so you can create a task that remember you this activity for the class, with the deadline.
3. Show a simple dashboard with some filters where you can consult the open tasks.

## 2. Which framework was use?
Electron  JS
